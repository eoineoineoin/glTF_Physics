These models are intended to test combinations of physics material properties.

Each model contains one static geometry and two dynamic bodies which differ only in their initial position and physics material used. This allows for testing the material properties have some effect.

Note, the sample images display a representation of the physics system and do not necessarily reflect the materials contained in the model.
